                      <h4>The legend</h4>
                      <p>
                        Legend has it that Kaldi, a goat-herder from Ethiopia in
                        the 9th century went out to search for some of his
                        missing goats, only to find them energetically dancing
                        and eating the berries of a small tree which he had
                        never seen before. Wondering what could be the cause of
                        these effects on the goats he decided to try the berries
                        himself, feeling a rush of vitality come to him a little
                        while after eating the berries. After this beautiful
                        experience, he became determined to show this new great
                        discovery to the world.
                      </p>
                      <br />
                      <p>
                        And so, Kaldi brought the berries to a nearby monastery,
                        but the monks disapproved of this rare fruit fearing
                        that its effects could be related to demons or evil
                        spirits. The monks then proceeded to throw the berries
                        into the fire, from which an exquisite smell poured out
                        that caused nearby people to come and see what was that
                        fragrance.

                        fire by the monks then ground and put into water, making
                        it the first cup of coffee in the history of the world.

                        to this beverage’s origins and there should be some
                        truth behind it, such as the discovery of the energizing
                        effect of coffee by someone mistakenly eating those
                        berries.

                        15th centry but there are a lot of discussions where
                        exactly coffee was discovered: whether it was Ethiopia
                        and then it spread up North or it was in Yemen..

                      <h4>Varieties</h4>
                      <p>
                        There are two main varieties of coffee beans: Arabica
                        and Robusta. The primary distinctions lie in the
                        altitude at which they thrive and their immunity to
                        pests, particularly in terms of caffeine content.
                        Arabica, being more sensitive and less resistant,
                        typically flourishes at higher altitudes, starting from
                        approximately 1200 meters above sea level.

                        These are just a few of most popular specialty coffee
                        varieties:

                        <h5>Typica</h5>

                          It is one of the two parent varieties of coffee
                          cultivars, selectively bred for over 500 years. Typica
                          offers a sweet, mild, and approachable flavor. Notes
                          of chocolate and nut take center stage, complemented
                          by hints of spice. Typica's acidity is mild and
                          balanced, conjuring dried fruit and dark stone fruit
                          like black cherry and plum.

                          culturally and genetically important. A parent of
                          numerous coffee varieties, Bourbon delivers brown
                          sugar-like sweetness, fruit notes of cherry and peach,

                          its smaller plant size and higher production. Similar

                          forest, is highly valued for rarity, production costs,
                          and flavor. Light, bright, and floral, with tea-like

                        <h5>Espresso</h5>
                        <p>
                          It is a concentrated coffee brewing method where
                          pressurized hot water is forced through finely-ground
                          coffee. It results in a strong, rich, and flavorful
                          shot of coffee, commonly used as a base for various
                          coffee beverages.

                        <p>
                          In this brewing, coarse coffee grounds are steeped in
                          hot water, and a plunger with a mesh filter is used to
                          separate the grounds after brewing. This method
                          produces a full-bodied and robust cup of coffee.

                        <p>
                          This method involves brewing coffee by immersing
                          grounds in water and then using air pressure to push
                          the brewed coffee through a filter. It's known for its
                          versatility and the ability to produce a clean cup of
                          coffee.

                          This brewing involves pouring hot water over coffee
                          grounds in a slow, controlled manner. This method
                          allows for precise control over brewing variables and
                          is appreciated for highlighting the nuanced flavors of
                          the coffee.

                        <p>
                          It is made by steeping coarse coffee grounds in cold
                          water for an extended period, often 12-24 hours. The
                          result is a smooth, less acidic, and highly
                          caffeinated coffee concentrate that is typically
                          diluted before consumption.

                          In this brewing method, finely ground coffee, water,
                          and sugar (optional) are combined and brewed in a
                          special pot called a cezve. The coffee is heated
                          without boiling and served unfiltered in small cups,
                          grounds and all.

                        <p>
                          This brewing method uses a vacuum process to brew
                          coffee. Water is heated in the lower chamber, and as
                          it rises, it mixes with coffee grounds. After brewing,
                          a vacuum effect draws the brewed coffee back down,
                          leaving the grounds behind.

                  missing goats, only to find them energetically dancing
                  and eating the berries of a small tree which he had
                  never seen before. Wondering what could be the cause of
                  these effects on the goats he decided to try the berries
                  himself, feeling a rush of vitality come to him a little
                  while after eating the berries. After this beautiful
                  experience, he became determined to show this new great

                  that its effects could be related to demons or evil
                  spirits. The monks then proceeded to throw the berries
